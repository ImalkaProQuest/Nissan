Dear {!Evaluation_Booking__c.Contact_First_Name__c},

Thank you for your recent request to evaluate the Nissan {!Evaluation_Booking__c.Vehicle_Name__c}.

Your booking has been confirmed for the period {!Evaluation_Booking__c.Start_Date__c} to {!Evaluation_Booking__c.End_Date__c}.
Please be aware that as part of the evaluation process, before you take delivery of the vehicle you will need to review, sign and return the “Vehicle Loan Acceptance” form.

The form contains important information regarding details of the vehicle you are evaluating and terms and conditions of use including insurance and liability for damage.

If the vehicle is being transported to you by a third party logistics provider your Nissan Fleet contact will arrange collection of the Vehicle Loan Acceptance form separately.

If you would like to cancel your vehicle evaluation please click here.
Please reach out to your Nissan Fleet Contact should you have any questions regarding this Nissan vehicle evaluation. 

Sincerely,

The Nissan Fleet team.</textOnly>
